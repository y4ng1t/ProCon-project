# Matrix and Arithmetic Calculator

The program gives selection by number 1 which is arithmetic and 2 which is matrix.

If the user give input 1 (Arithmetic Program)
The program will ask the User to input number and operator, the program will check the operator using switch case, if the user input multiplication than the program will do the multiplication, if the user input addition than the program will do the addition, if the user input subtraction than the program will do the subtraction ,if the user input division than the program will do the division, the program will calculate the summary, of calculation and then the program will write the output of calculation

If the user give input 2 (Matrix program)
The program will ask the User to input number into first array size and then the program will ask the User to input number into second array size and the user input first matrix number to the first array then the user input first matrix number to the second array then the program ask the user to input an operator and then the program will check what’s kind of operator is it, If the user input multiplication if true then the program will do the multiplication of the matrix and give an output of calculation, if the user input  is not multiplication than the program will check is the user give an addition input if yes than the program will check if both array size are the same if yes then the program will check if both array size are the same,if the array size is the same and then the program will do the addition of the matrix and give an output of calculation, if the array size is not the same the program will give an text output “ordo needs to be the same to perform this operation”,if the user input is not addition then the program will check if the user give an subtraction input if yes than then the program will check if both array size are the same,if the array size is the same and then the program will do the addition of the matrix and give an output of the subtraction, if the array size is not the same the program will give an text output “ordo needs to be the same to perform this operation”.

After giving an output of calculation or text output the program will ask rather the user want to continue to  calculate or no,if the user want to continue the calculation then the user will be giving an input and the program will read it as yes and the program will begin again from input number and operator,if the user don’t want to continue then the user will give an input and the program will read is as no and then the program will stop /end.
